# BlackJack-Game

In this project I created a simple game, **BlackJack!**. This game was created using Java.

Both you and the House are dealt two cards: one is face up and the other face down. So you can see only one of the House's cards and it can see only one of yours.
Each card has a score as follows:
* An Ace has a score of 1.
* A Jack, Queen or King has a score of 10, and all other cards have a score equal to their rank.
* The House will obtain additional cards until its score is 17 or more.
* You are asked if you want another card. If you answer yes, you get another face down card and you will asked again. This continues until you say "no". This ends the game.
* All cards are now turned face-up and the scores of you and the House are calculated.
* You lose if your score is more than 21 (no matter what the House's score is).
* You lose if your score is the same as the House's. You win if:
* You don't go over 21 and the House does go over 21
* Both your scores are 21 or under and your score is more than the House's.
